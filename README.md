# Eros

A Haskell library for text censorship, using
[DansGuardian Phraselists](http://contentfilter.futuragts.com/phraselists/).

I converted those Phraselists to JSON. You can see the converted Phraselists
[here](https://github.com/pharpend/eros/tree/master/res/phraselists-pretty). There
are
[compressed versions](https://github.com/pharpend/eros/tree/master/res/phraselists-ugly)
for use in your code.

Eros is still in development, and is not ready to be actually used. If you would
like to contribute, please do.
